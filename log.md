# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 7th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: First stream, planning out my #100daysofcode schedule, app planning

**Thoughts:** Not a lot of code written, but a lot of system, api, model design for `figure out dinner` app

### Day 1: September 8th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Starting review of [Algorithms Illuminated by Tim Roughgarden](http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/)

**Thoughts:** Rereading chapter one, created a repo so I can implement algos in the material on python notebooks.  Also thought about `figure out dinner`, maybe I should look into barcode apis as phase two and ingredient detection in a later phase
