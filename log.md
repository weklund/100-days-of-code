# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 7th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: First stream, planning out my #100daysofcode schedule, app planning

**Thoughts:** Not a lot of code written, but a lot of system, api, model design for `figure out dinner` app

**Link to work:** [Figure Out Dinner](https://github.com/weklund/figure-out-dinner-app)

### Day 1: September 8th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Starting review of [Algorithms Illuminated by Tim Roughgarden](http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/)

**Thoughts:** Rereading chapter one, created a repo so I can implement algos in the material on python notebooks.  Also thought about `figure out dinner`, maybe I should look into barcode apis as phase two and ingredient detection in a later phase

### Day 2: September 12th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: 
 * Got local notebook environment working
 * Implemented a working Karatsuba Multiplication solution with recursion from section 1.3 of [Algorithms Illuminated by Tim Roughgarden](http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/)

**Thoughts:**
* Discovered great content from [Adam](https://adamlearns.com/) who just received multiple offers from FAANG companies, who streamed for 2 straight months for prep 
* Forgot that dividing multiple `int` together in Python 3 makes the answer a float
