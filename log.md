# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 7th, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** First stream, planning out my #100daysofcode schedule, app planning

**Thoughts:** Not a lot of code written, but a lot of system, api, model design for `figure out dinner` app

**Link to work:** [Figure Out Dinner](https://github.com/weklund/figure-out-dinner-app)

### Day 1: September 8th, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Starting review of [Algorithms Illuminated by Tim Roughgarden](http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/)

**Thoughts:** Rereading chapter one, created a repo so I can implement algos in the material on python notebooks.  Also thought about `figure out dinner`, maybe I should look into barcode apis as phase two and ingredient detection in a later phase

### Day 2: September 12th, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** 
 * Got local notebook environment working
 * Implemented a working Karatsuba Multiplication solution with recursion from section 1.3 of [Algorithms Illuminated by Tim Roughgarden](http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/)

**Thoughts:**
* Discovered great content from [Adam](https://adamlearns.com/) who just received multiple offers from FAANG companies, who streamed for 2 straight months for prep 
* Forgot that dividing multiple `int` together in Python 3 makes the answer a float

### Day 3: September 13th, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** 
 * Started on Grokking the Coding Interview, created a [repo](https://github.com/weklund/patterns-for-coding-questions) for note taking of various patterns
 * Explained the Sliding Window pattern and where it can be used
 * Completed Max Sum of Subarray of Size K problem using Sliding Window

**Thoughts:**
 * It's tough to clean the rust of Python while streaming and reviewing forgotten concepts lol 
 * I need to get better at reading all the code when there's an issue instead of immediately printing to debug.  I'll understand it better when I run through the computations mentally.

### Day 4: September 14th, 2020

**Yesterday's Accomplishments:**
 * Started Grokking the Coding Interview
 * Relearned the Sliding Window pattern and took good notes
 * Solved the first problem in the series using Sliding Window
 
**Today's Goals:**
 * Remember to read through logic before immediately starting to debug (printing fun)

**Today's Accomplishments:** 
 * Completed Smallest Subarray with a given sum problem using Sliding Window 
 * Did not have to print anything during my debugging, getting better at mentally reviewing buggy code

**Thoughts:**
 * I could have a faster recall on list comprehension
 * Had the meat of the logic correct, but I had incorrectly used the wrong loop structure.  Beat myself up pretty bad about it but I need to remember I'm actually going above and beyond what the course wants.  The real exercises aren't until the 'Problem Challenges'
